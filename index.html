<p>This site exists as a sort of hub for organizing things. And also a better profile than whatever social media this is on, can provide for me.</p>
<p>also: Here's music. If you want it. (this should change on reload. and will also break at some point in the future)</p>

<p>This site will be uniquely mine, as though my ability to code sites is complete dogshit right now, it will still be up to date on myself. Not in terms of being a blog or journal, but to just list the states of my interests or projects.</p>
<p>Going back on saying that this "will still be up to date on myself" I cannot guarantee how often I can update this site. I'm very busy with too much shit. I will still try to keep this as up to date as possible. Anyways; Click on the tabs on the side, their name is very obviously what they will lead you to. If a tab doesn't work: It's not done yet! either that or i fucked it up but most likely the first. Just check back again in a few!</p>
